- 👋 Hi, I’m @RogueFalcon1079

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new coding skills and best practices for .NET development, with an interest in looking at more front end development with Javascript, HTML and CSS in the longterm.

- 🌱 I’m currently developing my C# skills via desktop developments using .NET 5 and above, and support existing web services written in .NET Framework 4.5 while also developing new web services potentially in newer .net implementations.
